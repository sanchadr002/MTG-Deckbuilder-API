User Story:<br/>
<br/>
As a user, I want to...<br/>
<br/>
Build decks according to official tournament-legal Wizards of the Coast criteria.<br/>
<br/>
Edit and delete decks that I build so that I can change my decks to reflect.<br/>
<br/>
View an index of decks that I've created so I know what I have.<br/>
<br/>
Search cards by various paramaters, including card name, mana color, mana cost, and type so I can cast as wide or as narrow a net I want.<br/>
<br/>
See my deck as I'm building it so I know what I already have.<br/>
